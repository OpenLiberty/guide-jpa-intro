== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use the Java Persistence API (JPA) to map Java objects to relational database 
tables and perform create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations on the data in your microservices. 

JPA is a Java EE specification for representing relational database table data as Plain Old Java Objects (POJO).
JPA simplifies object-relational mapping (ORM) by using annotations to map Java objects 
to tables in a relational database. In addition to providing an efficient API for performing
CRUD operations, JPA also reduces the burden of having to write JDBC and SQL code when performing
database operations and takes care of database vendor-specific differences. This capability allows you to 
focus on the business logic of your application instead of wasting time implementing repetitive CRUD logic.

The application that you will be working with is an event manager, which is composed of a UI
and an event microservice for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting events. In this 
guide, you will be focused on the event microservice. The event microservice consists of
a JPA entity class whose fields will be persisted to a database. The database logic is implemented in 
a Data Access Object (DAO) to isolate the database operations from the rest of the service. 
This DAO accesses and persists JPA entities to the database and can be injected 
and consumed by other components in the microservice. An Embedded Derby database is used 
as a data store for all the events.

You will use JPA annotations to define an entity class whose fields are persisted to the 
database. The interaction between your service and the database is mediated by the persistence 
context that is managed by an entity manager. In a Java EE environment, you can use an
application-managed entity manager or a container-managed entity manager. In this guide, 
you will use a container-managed entity manager that is injected into the DAO so the application  
server manages the opening and closing of the entity manager for you.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, run the following commands to navigate to the `finish/frontendUI` directory and
deploy the `frontendUI` service to Open Liberty:

[role="command"]
----
cd finish/frontendUI
mvn liberty:run
----

Open another command-line session and run the following commands to navigate to the `finish/backendServices` directory and
deploy the service to Open Liberty:
[role="command"]
----
cd finish/backendServices
mvn liberty:run
----

After you see the following message in both command-line sessions, both your services are ready.

[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

Point your browser to the {eventapp-url} URL. The event application does not display any events
because no events are stored in the database. Go ahead and click `Create Event`, located in the 
left navigation bar. After entering an event name, location and time, click `Submit` to persist your 
event entity to the database. The event is now stored in the database and is visible in the list of 
current events.

Notice that if you stop the Open Liberty server and then restart it, the events created
are still displayed in the list of current events. Ensure you are in the `finish/backendServices` directory and run the following Maven goals to stop
and then restart the server:
[role=command] 
```
mvn liberty:stop
mvn liberty:run
```

The events created are still displayed in the list of current events. The `Update` action link
located beside each event allows you to make modifications to the persisted entity and the 
`Delete` action link allows you to remove entities from the database.

After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty servers by pressing CTRL+C in the
command-line sessions where you ran the `backendServices` and `frontendUI` services.
Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `finish` directory in another command-line session for the `frontendUI`
and `backendServices` services:
[role="command"]
----
mvn liberty:stop
----

// =================================================================================================
// Defining a JPA entity class
// =================================================================================================

== Defining a JPA entity class

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

When you run Open Liberty in dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change.

Run the following commands to navigate to the `frontendUI` directory and start the `frontendUI` service in dev mode:

[role="command"]
----
cd frontendUI
mvn liberty:dev
----

Open another command-line session and run the following commands to navigate to
the `backendServices` directory and start the service in dev mode:

[role="command"]
----
cd backendServices
mvn liberty:dev
----

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

[role="no_copy"]
----
************************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

Dev mode holds your command line to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, 
or open the project in your editor.

To store Java objects in a database, you must define a JPA entity class. A JPA entity is a Java 
object whose non-transient and non-static fields will be persisted to the database. Any Plain Old 
Java Object (POJO) class can be designated as a JPA entity. However, the class must be annotated
with the `@Entity` annotation, must not be declared final and must have a public or protected non-argument
constructor. JPA maps an entity type to a database table and persisted instances will be represented 
as rows in the table.

The [hotspot=Event]`Event` class is a data model that represents events in the event microservice and is annotated with JPA
annotations.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `Event` class.#

The following table breaks down the new annotations:

[cols="35, 200", options="header"]
|===
| *Annotation*    | *Description*
| [hotspot=Entity]`@Entity` | Declares the class as an entity
| [hotspot=Table]`@Table`  | Specifies details of the table such as name 
| [hotspot=NamedQuery]`@NamedQuery` | Specifies a predefined database query that is run by an `EntityManager` instance.
| [hotspot=Id]`@Id`       |  Declares the primary key of the entity
| [hotspot=GeneratedValue]`@GeneratedValue`    | Specifies the strategy used for generating the value of the primary key. 
                        The `strategy = GenerationType.AUTO` code indicates that the generation strategy 
                        is automatically selected
                        
| [hotspot=Column]`@Column`    | Specifies that the field is mapped to a column in the database table. The `name`
                 attribute is optional and indicates the name of the column in the table

== Configuring JPA

The [hotspot file=0]`persistence.xml` file is a configuration file that defines a persistence unit. The
persistence unit specifies configuration information for the entity manager.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the configuration file.#
`backendServices/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`
----
persistence.xml
[source, Xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml[]
----

The persistence unit is defined by the [hotspot=persistence-unit file=0]`persistence-unit` XML element. The [hotspot=transaction-type file=0]`name` attribute is 
required and is used to identify the persistent unit when using the `@PersistenceContext`
annotation to inject the entity manager later in this guide. The [hotspot=transaction-type file=0]`transaction-type="JTA"` 
attribute specifies to use Java Transaction API (JTA) transaction management.
Since we are using a container-managed entity manager, JTA transactions must be used. 

A JTA transaction type requires a JTA data source to be provided. The [hotspot=jta-data file=0]`jta-data-source` 
element specifies the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) name of 
the data source that is used. The [hotspot=data-source file=1]`data source` has already been configured for you
in the [hotspot file=1]`backendServices/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file. This data source configuration is where 
the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connection is defined along with some database
vendor-specific properties.

The [hotspot=eclipse-link file=0]`eclipselink.ddl-generation` properties are used here so that you aren't required to 
manually create a database table to run this sample application. To learn more about the 
`ddl-generation` properties, see the 
http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.5/jpa/extensions/p_ddl_generation.htm[JPA Extensions Reference for EclipseLink.^]

== Performing CRUD operations using JPA

The CRUD operations are defined in the DAO. To perform these operations by using JPA, we need an [hotspot=EventDao file=0]`EventDao` class. 

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `EventDao` class.#

To use the entity manager at runtime, inject it into our CDI bean through the
[hotspot=PersistenceContext file=0]`@PersistenceContext` annotation. The entity manager interacts with the persistence context. 
Every `EntityManager` instance is associated with a persistence context. The persistence context 
manages a set of entities and is aware of the different states that an entity can have.
The persistence context synchronizes with the database when a transaction commits.

The [hotspot=EventDao file=0]`EventDao` class has a method for each CRUD operation, so let's break them down:

* The [hotspot=createEvent file=0]`createEvent()` method persists an instance of the [hotspot=Event file=1]`Event` entity class to the data store by
calling the [hotspot=Persist file=0]`persist()` method on an `EntityManager` instance. The entity instance becomes managed
and changes to it will be tracked by the entity manager.

* The [hotspot=readEvent file=0]`readEvent()` method returns an instance of the [hotspot=Event file=1]`Event` entity class with the specified primary 
key by calling the [hotspot=Find file=0]`find()` method on an `EntityManager` instance. If the event instance is found, it
is returned in a managed state, but, if the event instance is not found, `null` is returned.

* The [hotspot=readAllEvents file=0]`readAllEvents()` method demonstrates an alternative way to retrieve event objects 
from the database. This method returns a list of instances of the `Event` entity class by 
using the `Event.findAll` query specified in the [hotspot=NamedQuery file=1]`@NamedQuery` annotation on the [hotspot=Event file=1]`Event` class. 
Similarly, the [hotspot=findEvent file=0]`findEvent()` method uses the `Event.findEvent` named query to find an event 
with the given name, location and time. 

Event.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/event/models/Event.java[]
----

* The [hotspot=updateEvent file=0]`updateEvent()` method creates a managed instance of a detached entity instance. 
The entity manager automatically tracks all managed entity objects in its persistence context 
for changes and synchronizes them with the database. However, if an entity becomes detached, 
you must merge that entity into the persistence context by calling the [hotspot=Merge file=0]`merge()` method 
so that changes to loaded fields of the detached entity are tracked.

* The [hotspot=deleteEvent file=0]`deleteEvent()` method removes an instance of the [hotspot=Event file=1]`Event` entity class from the database by 
calling the [hotspot=Remove file=0]`remove()` method on an `EntityManager` instance. The state of the entity is
changed to removed and is removed from the database upon transaction commit. 

The DAO is injected into the [hotspot=DAO file=2]`backendServices/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/event/resources/EventResource.java`
class and used to access and persist data. The [hotspot=Transactional file=2]`@Transactional` annotation is used in the
[hotspot=EventResource file=2]`EventResource` class to declaratively control the transaction boundaries on the [hotspot=RequestedScoped file=2]`@RequestScoped` CDI bean.
This ensures that the methods run within the boundaries of an active global transaction, which is why it is not
necessary to explicitly begin, commit or rollback transactions. At the end of the transactional
method invocation, the transaction commits and the persistence context flushes any changes
to Event entity instances it is managing to the database.

When the server is running, go to the {eventapp-url} URL to view the Event Manager application. 

Click `Create Event` in the left navigation bar to create events that are persisted to 
the database. After you create an event, it is available to view, update, and delete in
the `Current Events` section.

The [hotspot=testInvalidRead]`testInvalidRead()`, [hotspot=testInvalidDelete]`testInvalidDelete()` and [hotspot=testInvalidUpdate]`testInvalidUpdate()` methods use a primary key that is not in the database to test reading, updating and deleting an event that does not
exist, respectively.

The [hotspot=testReadIndividualEvent]`testReadIndividualEvent()` method persists a test event to the database and retrieves the 
event object from the database using the primary key of the entity.

The [hotspot=testCURD]`testCRUD()` method creates a test event and persists it to the database. The event object is then 
retrieved from the database to verify that the test event was actually persisted. Next, the  
name, location, and time of the test event are updated. The event object is retrieved 
from the database to verify that the updated event is stored. Finally, the updated test 
event is deleted and one final check is done to ensure that the updated test event is no longer 
stored in the database.
